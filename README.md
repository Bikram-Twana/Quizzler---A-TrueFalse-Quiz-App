# Quizzler---A-TrueFalse-Quiz-App
A TrueFalse Quiz App

 
This is a quiz app that tests your general knowledge. In this app I used fundamental building blocks of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - Classes and Objects Concepts. 
You can either choose 'True' or 'False' as the answer on random quiz questions. You get green tick Icon for correct answer and cross red Icon for the wrong answer.  


This is how app looks like :
